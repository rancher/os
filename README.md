# RancherOS

The smallest, easiest way to run Docker in production at scale.  Everything in RancherOS is a container managed by Docker.  This includes system services such as udev and rsyslog.  RancherOS includes only the bare minimum amount of software needed to run Docker.  This keeps the binary download of RancherOS very small.  Everything else can be pulled in dynamically through Docker.

## How this works

Everything in RancherOS is a Docker container.  We accomplish this by launching two instances of
Docker.  One is what we call the system Docker which runs as the first process.  System Docker then launches
a container that runs the user Docker.  The user Docker is then the instance that gets primarily
used to create containers.  We created this separation because it seemed logical and also
it would really be bad if somebody did `docker rm -f $(docker ps -qa)` and deleted the entire OS.
