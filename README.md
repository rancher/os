> RancherOS 1.x is currently in a maintain-only-as-essential mode. It is no longer being actively maintained at a code level other than addressing critical or security fixes. For more information about the support status of RancherOS, see [this page.](https://support.rancher.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041771072#development-status-0-0)

The smallest, easiest way to run Docker in production at scale.  Everything in RancherOS is a container managed by Docker.  This includes system services such as udev and rsyslog.  RancherOS includes only the bare minimum amount of software needed to run Docker.  This keeps the binary download of RancherOS very small.  Everything else can be pulled in dynamically through Docker.

## How this works

Everything in RancherOS is a Docker container.  We accomplish this by launching two instances of
Docker.  One is what we call the system Docker which runs as the first process.  System Docker then launches
a container that runs the user Docker.  The user Docker is then the instance that gets primarily
used to create containers.  We created this separation because it seemed logical and also
it would really be bad if somebody did `docker rm -f $(docker ps -qa)` and deleted the entire OS.

**Note**:
1. you can use `http` instead of `https` in the above URLs, e.g. for iPXE.
2. you can use `latest` instead of `v1.5.8` in the above URLs if you want to get the latest version.

### Amazon

SSH keys are added to the **`rancher`** user, so you must log in using the **rancher** user.
