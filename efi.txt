To install with EFI:

A: install grub-efi

apt install grub-efi

B: Add to the installation process in scripts/package-iso

1. Make directories ${CD}/boot/grub and ${CD}/EFI/BOOT
2. Install the various grub modules from /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi/ to ${CD}/boot/grub/x86_64-efi/
3. Copy scripts/grub.cfg to ${CD}/boot/grub/grub.cfg
4. Run grub-mkimage to create the grub image: 

(cd ${CD} && grub-mkimage  -O x86_64-efi -o EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI --config=boot/grub/grub.cfg --compression=auto --prefix='()/boot/grub' disk part_msdos fat iso9660 )

NOTE: do *NOT* try to install the linux module directly in the grub image; it causes command-line options not to be passed and is a known bug.

5. Add the following xorriso options

    -eltorito-alt-boot -e EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI -no-emul-boot \
    -isohybrid-gpt-basdat \

This installation includes *no* additional icons or drivers. It is just meant to get RancherOS booted on an EFI system.
If you want to add support for graphical installations, additional filesystems, and everything else.... you will need a lot more
