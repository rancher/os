# Contributing to libcompose

Want to hack on Libcompose? Awesome! Here are instructions to get you
started.

Libcompose is part of the [Docker](https://www.docker.com) project, and
follows the same rules and principles. If you're already familiar with
the way Docker does things, you'll feel right at home.

Otherwise, go read Docker's
[contributions guidelines](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),
[issue triaging](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/project/ISSUE-TRIAGE.md),
[review process](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/project/REVIEWING.md) and
[branches and tags](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/project/BRANCHES-AND-TAGS.md).

Happy hacking!
