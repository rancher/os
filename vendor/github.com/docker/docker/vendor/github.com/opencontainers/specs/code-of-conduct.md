# OpenContainers Code of Conduct

Behave as a community member, follow the code of conduct.

## Code of Conduct

The OpenContainers community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world.

When we disagree, we try to understand why.
Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and OpenContainers is no exception.
It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
Participants should be aware of these concerns.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct

The OpenContainers team does not condone any statements by speakers contrary to these standards.
The OpenContainers team reserves the right to deny participation any individual found to be engaging in discriminatory or harassing actions.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.
By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project.
